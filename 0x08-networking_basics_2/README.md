Tasks
0. Change your home IP
mandatory

Write a Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server with the below requirements.

Requirements:

    localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2
    facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8.
    The checker is running on Docker, so make sure to read this



If you’re running this script on a machine that you’ll continue to use, be sure to revert localhost to 127.0.0.1. Otherwise, a lot of things will stop working!
